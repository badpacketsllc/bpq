Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up ``bpq`` for local development.

1. Set up a Python environment. ``bpq`` requires only Python version 3.6 or
   higher. Pull requests for supporting older version of Python will be
   considered, but Python 3.3 or lower will never be supported.

2. Fork the `repo <https://github.com/badpacketsllc/bpq>`_ on GitHub

3. Clone the repo locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_username_here/bpq.git


4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature


6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Document
   your new feature using language-native documentation, and add the feature to
   the list in README.md.

3. If it creates a new release, add the changes to ``HISTORY.rst``.

4. If you are a new contributor, add yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.
